This repository contains the solutions for the exercises in the book "The
C Programming Language".

I tried to write all of them in the style the book
uses (variables always declared at the start of the function, braces on the
same line of if/while/for, etcetera). For the sake of organization, most
exercises were put in a single file if possible; otherwise they have been put
in their own directory.

All of these exercises should be compilable with just:

    gcc exn-n.c

or

    gcc *.c

for multi-file exercises.

I did these exercises at least two-three years ago and only now I decided to
revise and upload all of them. The revisions include style changes, code
organization or just plainly doing them again if I wasn't satisfied with
what I did back then (this mostly means code quality may vary).
